 * There is exactly one common bank, i.e. a bank that is always available during
 * execution of the program. Each bank has capacity measured in bytes that is
 * specified by a positive integer or zero. A partition of functions into banks
 * is an allocation of each function into exactly one bank such that all
 * functions allocated to the same bank do not exceed its capacity.</p>
