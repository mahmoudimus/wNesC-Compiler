 * <p>Interface with operations for dividing functions into multiple code

 * <p>The model of banks is as follows. There are N banks. Bank <code>i</code>
 * is capable of holding functions with the total size not greater than
 * <code>s<sub>i</sub></code> bytes where <code>s<sub>i</sub></code> is
 * a positive natural number. A partition is an assignment of each function to
 * a single bank such that the size of all functions in any single bank does not
 * exceed the capacity of the bank.</p>
